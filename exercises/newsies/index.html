It's Oct. 10, a little over two hours before the Vegas Golden Knights will play their first home game at the adjacent T-Mobile Arena, and members of their ice crew, drumline and front office are joining fans underneath the faux Brooklyn Bridge for a short march to the arena. On the way, they will high-five fans filling the bars and restaurants at The Park, an outdoor area lined with trees, waterfalls and restaurants between New York-New York and Monte Carlo, with a pathway that leads directly to the arena.
Inside the New York-New York, I'm the only one sitting in the closest sportsbook to the T-Mobile Arena. It's not particularly large, but considering one floor of the New York-New York parking garage is connected to the arena, it's the most convenient pit stop for fans on their way to the game. As noted earlier this week, the Vegas Golden Knights refuse to act like an expansion team.

At some point general manager George McPhee may start unloading some veterans for future assets -- adhering to his long-term vision for franchise-building -- but for now his team is a handful.

We note this because the Blues travel to Vegas Saturday for what was supposed to be a soft spot on their schedule. But the Golden Knights moved to 5-1 in their inaugural season with their 5-4 overtime victory over the visiting Buffalo Sabres Tuesday night.

"I think it's a better team than people expected," coach Gerard Gallant said during his postgame news conference. "After the expansion draft, when I saw the list of our team, I was pretty impressed. There are some top six forwards there that you don't expect to get in the expansion draft, but the rules are different. We got some real good, talented hockey players.

"You look at our so-called bottom six guys, they're competitive guys that work hard and come to the rink every night. So there's a lot of good hockey players there. We're probably scoring a little more that we thought we were going to score. But, again, when you've got players like that and they're hungry and they're working hard every night, they're having a of fun.
