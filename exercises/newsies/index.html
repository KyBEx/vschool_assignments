    <h1>Golden Knights Off To Hot Start</h1>

    <div class="column">

        <p>LAS VEGAS -- There is a party going on outside the New York-New York Hotel and Casino. It's Oct. 10, a little over two hours before the Vegas Golden Knights will play their first home game at the adjacent T-Mobile Arena, and members of their ice crew, drumline and front office are joining fans underneath the faux Brooklyn Bridge for a short march to the arena. On the way, they will high-five fans filling the bars and restaurants at The Park, an outdoor area lined with trees, waterfalls and restaurants between New York-New York and Monte Carlo, with a pathway that leads directly to the arena.
Inside the New York-New York, I'm the only one sitting in the closest sportsbook to the T-Mobile Arena. It's not particularly large, but considering one floor of the New York-New York parking garage is connected to the arena, it's the most convenient pit stop for fans on their way to the game.</p>
